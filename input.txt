Title: The Journey of Time

Once upon a time, in a land where time stood still, there was a small village nestled between the mountains
the weather was good
it was raining heavily
The villagers were content, living their lives with simplicity and grace
They had no need for clocks or calendars, as the sun's rise and set marked the passage of time
